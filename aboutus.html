                Having graduated in 1995 from one of the oldest and renowned medical colleges of Pakistan, Liaquat 
                Medical College, in a town named Jamshoro, Pakistan. I started my career at Liaquat Medical College Hospital Hyderabad branch, as an 
                Intern.
                I moved to Australia in 2008 with my family. I completed my Masters in Public Health from Monash 
                University in 2009 and I passed my AMC MCQ exam in 2012.
                After being a doctor for almost 2 decades I decided for a change. By change I mean change in career 
                and so I decided to do this course and explore new avenues.

                I am born and raised in Geelong and have just started to become a full web developer, trying to 
                make my way through this new and crazy world. I have always had an interest in technology but never
                found what I wanted to do. My carreer options led me down other avenues, so this is the first time 
                I will be doing anything along this nature. It has been tough but very exciting and hopefully I can 
                become a competent wed develper in no time.
